    <p>Nessy the NES Robot is a homebrew NES game created by Daniel T. Gaming and was originally made for Byte-Off 2019. This game was made using a game development software created by The New 8-Bit Heroes named "NESmaker", which allows you to create your own NES games, distribute them, and play them on either an emulator or actual hardware.</p>
    <p>This run saves 22.74 seconds off <a href="https://luigidasonic.github.io/TAS_movies/Nessy_the_NES_Robot_Demo_0.30_any_02_05_31_luigidasonic.html">my previous TAS of this game.</a></p>
    
    <h4>Timesaves</h4>
    
    <h5>Level 1 Lag Frame</h5>
    <p>The first timesave is in Level 1. In my 2-minute TAS, I shot one of the enemies. This lagged the game for one frame, resulting in me losing one frame.</p>
    <p>To save that one frame, I jumped over the enemy instead of shooting it. This caused no lag, which made this TAS one frame faster in level 1.</p>
    <p>I would've fell off the platform because of that jump, but thanks to the size of the platform's hitboxes, I was given one frame to jump off that platform.</p>
    <p>However, in order to get that one frame, I had to hold A for the right amount of frames when I jumped, so I would land on that exact pixel and be able to jump off of it.</p>
    
    <h5>Level 3 Boss Skip</h5>
    <p>Another timesave is in Level 3.</p>
    <p>NESmaker (the game engine Nessy was made with) uses parts of a map named "screens", which contain the game's levels.</p>
    <p>In Nessy, the screens scroll horizontally, so going right will scroll the screen next to the screen you're on to the left. However, if you go to the bottom of the screen you're on, you will be teleported to the screen below it.</p>
    <p>Coincidentally, the exit screen for the boss fight is underneath one of the regular screens, so if you manage to get to the bottom of that screen, you can skip the boss fight.</p>
    <p>In order to get to the bottom of that screen, I had to enter the door to that screen with enough falling speed to get underneath the ground and reach the bottom of the screen, skipping Level 3's boss fight entirely.</p>
